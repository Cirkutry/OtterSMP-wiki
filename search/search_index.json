The rewards in this crate are the most notable out of the three listed. Key-wise, this is definitely the hardest to get out of the bunch, but for good reason.

These chests, which have different rarities, can be opened with right-click. The loot given to the player can be claimed after the dungeon is over by doing /rewards.</p> <p>The dungeons system is also used to enter/leave set pieces during the campaign.

This class is often used to negate fire damage on the dungeons map The Crypt. It is known for it's ability to tank bosses/mobs as well as it's axe, which can be used to clear lower-level enemies rather easily. However, any of the other classes are better for damage per second due to how axes work. The Knight's ability, Courage, gives the player a 20% chance to negate any hit as well as a 15% chance for resistance 2 for 10 seconds when taking damage.</p>"},{"location":"Dungeons/#mage","title":"Mage","text":"<p>The Mage class is equipped with a full set of golden armor, golden sword, a bow and arrow, and 4x golden apples at it's un-upgraded level. This class is definitely on the weaker side in my opinion, due to it's lack of food minus the golden apples. However, the ability the Mage is provided with, Arcane, gives anyone who choices this class permanent regeneration 1 and grants it to anyone nearby for 15 seconds. It is unclear how exactly this works, and when the set decides to give this regeneration to others. This trait makes the class a popular pick despite it's clear flaws.</p>"},{"location":"Dungeons/#rogue","title":"Rogue","text":"<p>The Rogue class is equipped with a full set of leather armor, iron sword, a crossbow, and 12x fish at it's un-upgraded level. This class is the speediest out of the three due to it's ability known as Assassin. This trait gives the player both invisibility 1 and speed 1 whenever they crouch for 10 seconds. They also have a 20% chance to get strength 1 while fighting. This class is a perfect choice for anyone who is able to skillfully speedrun dungeons. The iron sword, which when fully upgraded has sharpness 3, is also the best choice for damage per second.</p>"},{"location":"Dungeons/#maps","title":"Maps","text":"<p>Currently, there are two dungeon maps available for any player who wants to play.</p>"},{"location":"Dungeons/#the-crypt","title":"The Crypt","text":"<p>The Crypt is the first Dungeons map released in December of 2023, although was later changed to be the second map in the story.
