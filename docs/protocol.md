# MODERATION PROTOCOL

## ğŸ”° **NON-ENGLISH**

Speaking any language other than English.

Verbal warn: Ask them to use `/msg`.

If they don't respond, copy their messages, paste them in a translator & locate the language. Then translate a simple English message like "Please use /msg" into their language, & paste in chat. This is mandatory for the first 3 offenses.

## ğŸ”° **SPAM**

If the same or similar message is repeated 5 times within one minute it's considered spam. Begging/asking for items in chat is fine, only mute for it if they actually spam it like any other message.

Verbal warn: Tell them spamming is against the rules and ask them not to. If someone is spamming tp requests, you can always suggest ask the reciever of requests to use `/tptoggle`.

!!! warning "Note"

    + You can jail the player spamming the tp request for 1 hour if they refuse to stop.
    + If it's clear that someone's intent is to spam, and they do it non-stop Sr.Mods+ have the freedom to set the punishment duration as they see fit.
    + If someone is spamming things like "What's 2+2? [b8afcf8d6a7e5ff5072bb3d3ed90ad2a]", they're using hacks - it's a hacked client feature. Please see the illegal mods protocol for this.

## ğŸ”° **DRAMA**

Generally speaking, whenever a discussion or argument is carried out more than it has to, but doesn't necessarily escalate to other protocol offenses.

!!! warning "Note"

    Due to how vague the reason of the drama can be, Mods+ have the right to choose the duration of the punishment after the first offense as they see fit. If someone is renowned for making drama, you may also ban them.

Verbal warn: Try to understand what happened in order to determine if it's something else rather than drama (unfair PVP, swearing, spam etc), and ask the people fighting to either stop, move to `/msg`, or open a player report ticket on Discord.

In case the chat becomes too messy to understand, you get ignored or you log on and the drama is already ongoing, you can either proceed with muting anyone involved for 5-10 minutes as a cooldown period, or directly  proceed with the mute template.

ğŸ§· **Mute tag: Drama**

ğŸ“Œ **Mute template: 1h**

___

## ğŸ”° **HATE SPEECH**

ğŸ“Œ **Mute Template: 12h**

___

## ğŸ”° **TOXICITY**

Constant targetted harassment of player(s), aggressive and disruptive behavior (i.e. threatening and bullying of other players). This can range from verbal to actions of the players in-game (repeated killing of player/players for no reason).

Verbal warn: Tell them to stop such an action as it is not allowed and will result in a ban. Sr.Mods+ have the freedom to set the punishment duration as they see fit.

ğŸ“Œ **Ban Template: 1d**

___

## ğŸ”° **INAPROPRIATE TALK**

Engaging in discussions about inappropriate topics, issuing threats, or participating in any behavior that promotes or poses a threat of harm to oneself or others is strictly prohibited. This includes using sexual words, encouraging suicide, talking about hurting oneself, and making serious threats to other players. This doesn't require a warning but, if you feel a warn is necessary, please warn. Sr.Mods+ have the freedom to set the punishment duration as they see fit.

ğŸ§· **Mute Tag: Inappropriate Talk [1]**

ğŸ“Œ **Mute Template: 1d**

___

## ğŸ”° **GRIEFING**

Placing or breaking blocks, lava, water or generally making a huge mess around a base. Breaking 2-3 blocks, tempering of crop land, breaking doors is not considered as griefing.

Claiming an unclaimed base where the last owner's activity is older than 14 days is okay. If it's less than that and the owner wishes to get back their claim, Sr.Mods+ should delete the current claim.

Sr.Mods+ reserve the right to put a longer duration of punishment depending on the severity of the damage done to the base.

On heavy griefing if an Admin thinks the build was important to a player, say a house with lots of item that's damaged, they can rollback the whole thing to it's normal state.

Also note that if the killer returns the items and apologizes, staff don't have to take action.

ğŸ§· **Ban Tag: Illegal Mods (Fly/X-ray/etc) [1]**

ğŸ“Œ **Ban Template: 7d â‡¨ 15d â‡¨ Permanent**

If someone is spamming things like "What's 2+2? [b8afcf8d6a7e5ff5072bb3d3ed90ad2a]", they're using hacks - it's a hacked client feature.

Please ban them with this ban template but use Illegal Mods [1] as the ban tag instead, since no specific hack is being used but we know they're hacking.

___

## ğŸ”° **ADVERTISING**

Promoting other Minecraft servers related things such as IP addresses/websites etc. This also counts for in-game DMs, so if someone is advertising to players directly (and gets reported for doing so), you can punish them with this template

ğŸ§· **Ban Tag: Advertising [1]**

ğŸ“Œ **Ban Template: 15d â‡¨ Permanent**

VERBAL WARN: Tell them that exploiting our plugins/game mechanics is against the rules and they should stop doing it or risk getting banned.

ğŸ§· **Ban Tag: Glitch Abuse [1]**

ğŸ“Œ **Ban Template: 7d â‡¨ Permanent**

___

## ğŸ”° **IMPERSONATION**

Claiming to be someone else using usernames, nicknames, skins, signs, or books to confuse people.

!!! warning "Note"

    If someone is trying to login as staff/player under the same ingame name, follow the hijacking accounts protocol for this.

ğŸ§· **Ban Tag: Impersonation [1]**

ğŸ“Œ **Ban Template: Ban the person impersonating for 3d â‡¨ 7d â‡¨ Permanent, and permanently ban the account they made.**

___

## ğŸ”° **HIJACKING ACCOUNTS**

Logging in with another person's username to try and access their account.

Investigate if someone was really hacked by checking their IP history with `/iphist`. If different IPs show up, check which accounts are tied to all IPs involved so you find out the person trying to steal the account.

If you've found who the hacker's IGN is from the IP history, permanently ban the hacker's IGN and all accounts/IGNs tied to it like alts of the hackers (except any accounts which were hijacked).

After that, temp-ban the account they're trying to access for 30 Minutes with the following message:

Your account was recently accessed by a third party. You won't be able to log in temporarily.

ğŸ§· **Ban Tag: Hijacking Accounts**

ğŸ“Œ **Ban Template: Permanent**

___

## ğŸ”° **EVADING PUNISHMENT**

+ Evading mute:
>If someone is bypassing a mute through talking with an alt account in game or on Discord, warn them that bypassing will result in longer duration on their mute. But if they persist on doing it, please proceed to do the following actions.
>
>ğŸ§· **Mute Tag: Mute Evading**
>
>ğŸ“Œ **Mute Template: Mute the account in discord using the bot and mute the alt account in-game with the same duration as the main account punishment. If they keep on bypassing with more alts Sr.Mods+ can increase the mute duration of the original punishment.**

+ Evading ban:
>If someone is bypassing a ban through joining with an alt account in game or on discord. Please give them a warning that bypassing will result in a longer ban duration. If they persist on doing so after a warn, you may proceed with the following template.
>
>ğŸ§· **Ban Tag: Ban Evading**
>
>ğŸ“Œ **Ban Template: Ban all accounts involved with the same duration as the original punishment of the main account.**

!!! warning "Note"

      This protocol doesn't use a number in the mute/ban tags, as that would simply be confusing, due to this protocol being used off of other protocols which have numbers. If you ever need to follow this, just put Mute/Ban Evading without a number. If they keep on bypassing Sr.Mods+ can increase the ban duration of the original punishment.
