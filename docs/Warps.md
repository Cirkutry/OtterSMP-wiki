Warps are a form of transportation on the OtterSMP. They allow for quick, instantaneous travel throughout the world, similarly to Waystones.
## List of Warps

Below are a list of warps that are found on OtterSMP. Some are available on the GUI screen when players type /warp, while others are not.
### /warp color

/warp color takes you to the mini-game known as color shuffle that can be found just outside of spawn. This warp is mainly used for whenever the owners/staff team are hosting an event night.
### /warp crates

/warp crates, or just /crates, takes you to the section of spawn which holds the crate area. It can also be found on the GUI menu.
### /warp fishing

/warp fishing. or just /fishing, takes you directly to [Joshua](NPCs/Joshua.md), the fisherman NPC, as well as the lake at spawn.
### /warp forge

/warp forge, or just /forge, takes you to [Annie](NPCs/Annie the Blacksmith.md)'s workplace, known as The Forge. Inside, you can talk to Annie to repair any Artifact for a price.
### /warp guildmasters

Now a forgotten area, /warp guildmasters, or just /guildmasters, takes you to the empty area inside of the tree. Once a place where you could find the old guildmasters now lays abandoned. Something, eventually, will probably take it's place.
### /warp leaderboards

/warp leaderboards, or /leaderboards, takes you to the shop area in the spawn building. The key different between this and doing /shop is that you are facing leaderboards displaying OtterSMP's top miner in terms of blocks broken, player in terms of playtime, and earner in terms of money.
### /warp llama

/warp llama, or /llama, takes you to the area where the [vote party](Voteparty.md) occurs.
### /warp pvp
/warp pvp takes you to the area where the colosseum resides. It is used for special events held by the owners and staff team. Inside there, players can take turns duking it out, either against one of the owners themselves or against each other.
