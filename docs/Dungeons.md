Dungeons are a type of content available on OtterSMP that can be found at spawn. One can enter a dungeon by talking to Kirito at spawn or doing /dungeons.

## About Dungeons

Dungeons are an infinitely-repeatable sort of mini-game. These sectioned off, separate world adventures have the player battling their way through preset maps to find lootable chests and progress the world story. These chests, which have different rarities, can be opened with right-click. The loot given to the player can be claimed after the dungeon is over by doing /rewards.

The dungeons system is also used to enter/leave set pieces during the campaign. An example of this is the first mission of the campaign where the player is at Farnsworth.
## Classes

When entering a dungeon for the first time, the player is prompted to select a class. These classes act as the gear the player is given when entering a dungeon. There are three classes to choose from, the Knight, the Mage, and the Rogue. These classes can be upgraded by using money and class upgrade runes.
### Knight

The Knight class is equipped with a stone axe, iron/chainmail armor, 16x steak, and an enchanted golden apple at it's un-upgraded level. This class is often used to negate fire damage on the dungeons map The Crypt. It is known for it's ability to tank bosses/mobs as well as it's axe, which can be used to clear lower-level enemies rather easily. However, any of the other classes are better for damage per second due to how axes work. The Knight's ability, Courage, gives the player a 20% chance to negate any hit as well as a 15% chance for resistance 2 for 10 seconds when taking damage.
### Mage

The Mage class is equipped with a full set of golden armor, golden sword, a bow and arrow, and 4x golden apples at it's un-upgraded level. This class is definitely on the weaker side in my opinion, due to it's lack of food minus the golden apples. However, the ability the Mage is provided with, Arcane, gives anyone who choices this class permanent regeneration 1 and grants it to anyone nearby for 15 seconds. It is unclear how exactly this works, and when the set decides to give this regeneration to others. This trait makes the class a popular pick despite it's clear flaws.
### Rogue

The Rogue class is equipped with a full set of leather armor, iron sword, a crossbow, and 12x fish at it's un-upgraded level. This class is the speediest out of the three due to it's ability known as Assassin. This trait gives the player both invisibility 1 and speed 1 whenever they crouch for 10 seconds. They also have a 20% chance to get strength 1 while fighting. This class is a perfect choice for anyone who is able to skillfully speedrun dungeons. The iron sword, which when fully upgraded has sharpness 3, is also the best choice for damage per second.
## Maps

Currently, there are two dungeon maps available for any player who wants to play.
### The Crypt

The Crypt is the first Dungeons map released in December of 2023, although was later changed to be the second map in the story. This map is the location of the [commander](Commanders.md) The Necromancer, hence it's dark nature and scenery. The map's layout represents an evil, corrupt island. The player starts within a valley, and ventures deep inside of a cave where they can find The Necromancer across a lava lake.
### Spider Den

The Spider Den is the second map released in June of 2024. This map is the location of the commander known as the Lysandra, the Spider Queen, hence all the webs and spiders. The player spawns in outside a massive cave, and ventures deep inside to find and slay the the Spider Queen.
