Cosmetics are a form of virtual item found on OtterSMP that drastically changes the appearance of the player.

Cosmetics can be found within many aspects of the world, but most commonly in the crates. They can also be purchased from the Starfox, earned through Milestones, and also given from the Daily Daily system ran by Angel. Unfortunately, these items cannot (mostly) been seen by Bedrock players.

There are currently eight different types of cosmetics that can be found within OtterSMP. They are the following, gradients, pets, backpacks, hats, badges, player messages, balloons, and chat colors:
## Gradients

Gradients change the appearance of your username both in the chatbox, in the tab menu, and above your head when you are walking around. They come in a wide variety of different colors. They can be found in /gradients, or the /cosmetics menu.
## Pets

Pets give the player a familiar that follows them throughout the world. As of now, pets do not have any actual purpose or utility, but they look rather cute. They can be found in the /pets or /cosmetics menu.
## Backpacks

Backpacks equip the player with an item on their back. While unfortunately, these items do not allocate more inventory space, they are still a rather unique back piece that can elevate the entire look of the player. Despite the name, backpacks are the most uncommon item to find in this menu. A lot of cool wings and tails can be found by doing /backpacks or the /cosmetics menu.
## Hats

Hats equip the player with a piece of clothing on their head. Having the most vast selection of items to choose from, players can simply find this cosmetic by typing /hats or looking through the /cosmetics menu.
## Badges

Badges add a little icon next to the player's messages in the chatbox, next to their name in the tab menu, and above their head while they walk around. These symbols can be found by typing /badges or looking through the /cosmetics menu.
## Player Messages

Player Messages change the appearance of your server leave and server join messages. Instead of saying +(insert username) and -(insert username) when the player leaves in chat, it says something fancier. An example of this would be "(username) has been summoned by the moon!" These messages can be found in the /messages or /cosmetics menu.
## Balloons

Balloons give the player a little companion flying in the air behind them. These items are one of the more rare cosmetics on OtterSMP, and can be found in the /balloons menu or scrolling through the /cosmetics menu, on the second page to be specific.
## Chat Colors
Chat Colors completely overhaul the look of the player's text in the chatbox. Though rather useless if you do not type, these rather colorful pieces of text can make you stand out completely from everyone else. They can be found by typing /colors or looking through the /cosmetics menu on the second page.
