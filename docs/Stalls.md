Stalls are a form of rentable shop that can be found at spawn. Stalls are the only form of shop the player can create on OtterSMP. Run by Sarah, one can find them at /stalls. In simplest terms, the common auction house plugin found on many servers has instead been replaced by stalls to serve as a more lively, in person vendor. A stall can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 per in-real-life day depending on location and size.

Sarah offers the player a tutorial just outside the first stalls area outside the main spawn building. However, for those who need a refresher, this is the tutorial in broad terms. Players will need a chest, sign, any item you are trying to sell, and at least $2,000.
## Buy a Stall

To buy a stall, right click any stall sign with the appropriate funds. These signs can be located on the sides/in front of most stall buildings.
## Place a Chest

Place down your chest anywhere within the boundaries of your newly purchased stall.
## Hold out the Item

Players should then hold out the item that they want to sell. This is very important, and if a player holds out the wrong item, it won't work.
## Type the Command

We're almost done, simply type out the command /chestshop create and then the price they'd like to sell/buy said item. For example, if I wanted to sell a diamond for $50, I would hold my diamonds out and type /chestshop create $50. Players can change whether or not their shop is selling or buying by typing /chestshop buy or /chestshop sell and looking at their chest.
## Stock the Stall

Put the items you wanted to sell in the chest, and other people will be able to buy them as long as they are in there.

    Players can also click on any sign on someone else's stall chest to see a lot of information. Some of this information includes the amount of items someone else is selling/how many items are in the chest, who owns the shop, price per item, and even preview the item that is being sold to make sure they are not being scammed.
