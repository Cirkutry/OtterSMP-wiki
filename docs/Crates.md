The crates, or more commonly known as just crates, is our form of loot boxes that are as non-pay-to-win as possible. Inside of these special boxes include many items, such as cosmetics, special armor sets, fancy weapons, and even some tools. While this may seem at first incredibly overpowered, the way in which players acquire these keys is different compared to other servers out there. Instead of paying a premium to unlock crates, players can alternatively grind [dungeons](Dungeons.md), vote, unlock them in [milestones](Milestones.md), and in many more ways.
## List of Crates

There are three types of crates that are non-seasonal and do not rotate.
### Common Crate

The common crate is exactly as it sounds like - a crate that is filled with common rewards. Players are able to receive a common key through many avenues, such as voting, dungeons, the [Starfox](vendors/Starfox.md) shop, milestones and daily rewards. While the rewards in the crate may not blow you away, there are unique things like custom swords, pets, and a ton of cosmetics. You can also find early-game gear and furniture as well.
### Rare Crate

The rare crate holds more rarer (insert laughter here) rewards that are slightly harder to obtain. Getting the keys themselves, however, relatively stays the same. While yes, you could buy them from the server store and support us, you could also just grind even more dungeons, get some from milestones or the Starfox shop, or the dailies. The rewards stay relatively the same, but amp up in terms of coolness.
### Exotic Crate

The exotic crate is the highest tier of non-seasonal crates. The rewards in this crate are the most notable out of the three listed. Key-wise, this is definitely the hardest to get out of the bunch, but for good reason. To obtain an exotic key, one must either get to the very end of the milestones and daily rewards, buy it from the Starfox shop, or trade with other players. The best tools, cosmetics, and even armor sets are found in this crate.
### Seasonal Crates

Seasonal crates are crates in which rotate seasonally. Ever want a holiday-themed cosmetic or tool? You'll more than likely find them in these crates.
### Blighted Crate
The blighted crate is the first OtterSMP seasonal crate that released with the 2024's Demon's Den update. While you may only be able to get a key through this crate in the server store, many giveaways and opportunities are commonly available if you play enough. Inside this crate are where the real juicy rewards lie waiting to be collected. Gradients, badges, custom tools, and more are found in this crate.
