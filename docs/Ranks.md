Donator Ranks, or more commonly called ranks, are a special form of appreciation given to players who decide to donate money to OtterSMP through the [server store!](https://store.ottersmp.com/category/ranks).
## About Donator Ranks

There are currently 5 ranks that are available on the server store that range from $5.00 to $99.99. These include Allay, Ocelot, Piglin, Guardian, and Warden.
