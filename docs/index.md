# GUIDE

### ðŸŸ  **INTRODUCTION**

This is an extensive guide on how to follow our protocol and punishment system. For this guide we'll be using spam as an example protocol.

First thing you'll need to do is to look at the Protocol category. Once you find spam there, look at the ðŸ§· Mute Tag, and the ðŸ“Œ Mute Template.

!!! warning "Notice"

    Generally, you'll have an idea just by playing of what strike a player is on, but if not, you can use the CTRL+F shortcut when inside the [Punishment Log](https://discord.com/channels/374913317749260288/1116696335815540807) channel to quickly open the search bar in that specific channel, after which you can type the player's IGN to search for any past offenses.

Once you find out what strike the player is on, in this case assume they have already recieved two spam strikes in the past. Since this is their third, we'll give them the third duration in the mute template, with the `/tempmute` command in-game. The command syntax will be `/tempmute <player> <duration> <tag>`. For the tag, ALWAYS use the Mute Tag, replacing the number with the strike they're on. Here's what an example mute would look like:`/tempmute Dance 1d Spam [3]`. Please try to follow the wording as much as you can and keep the tags reasonable and tidy, to remain professional.

After you've done that, please upload the video recordings/screenshots of the offense in an Imgur album, and link it in the [Punishment Log](https://discord.com/channels/374913317749260288/1116696335815540807) channel right after your automated mute message appears. Strictly avoid uploading the media directly to the channel.

### ðŸŸ£ **IMGUR GUIDE**

1. Head over to the [Imgur website](https://imgur.com/), and click on the button labelled as `+ New post` in the top-left corner.
2. After that, you may upload all the images/videos at once by selecting them all in the pop-up, or select one first then add more by clicking the button labelled as `+ Add Image`.
3. Then, click on the button labelled as `Grab Link` at the top-right of the board to copy the link and proceed to paste it in the Punishment Log channel.

### ðŸŸ¡ **NOTE**

â€¢ Admins can revoke any punishment if they feel it's not fitting.
 
â€¢ If someone is bothering someone at their claim and won't leave, teleport them to spawn **twice**, so they can't do /back.

â€¢ Before doing a pinreset or login reset for players, always make sure they really own the account they want reset. Doing /iphist will help you but if you can't perform that command wait for someone who can.

### ðŸŸ¢ **PROFESSIONALISM**

Professionalism is just a base standard even in the most mundane of institutions. Even though this is just a small community server, it still has a framework to be followed. Anyone who steps out and acts out will be called out especially cause you are part of the staff team, a title not everyone has.  Deal with players with a stern air around you or they will assume you aren't serious about stuff.
