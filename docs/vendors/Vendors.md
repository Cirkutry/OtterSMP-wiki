Vendors are NPCs within OtterSMP with the sole purpose of buying and selling goods from the player. There are many of them within the world that mostly use money as a currency. Below are a list of vendors throughout the world and their location:

## Starfox

The [Starfox](Starfox.md) is a vendor located at spawn. The giant, purple, fluffy fox sells cosmetics, armor, and more and uses the currency known as Star Shards.
## Asuna

[Asuna](../NPCs/Asuna.md) is the most popular vendor and NPC within the world. She is the go-to person for anyone trying to earn money. Located in spawn at /shop, Asuna buys a majority of blocks, crops, and general items in the game from the players, and sells random items as well.
## Taylor

[Taylor](../NPCs/Taylor.md) is the Quicksell NPC. Located in the spawn at /shop, her sole purpose is to buy items from the player quickly, rather than sorting through Asuna's entire catalog. She buys items for the currency known as money.
## Jess

Located at spawn behind the stalls, [Jess](Jess.md) is the vendor meant for furniture and custom blocks. Her shop rotates on a daily basis, allowing more blocks and furniture to circle through.
## Annie

[Annie](../NPCs/Annie the Blacksmith.md) is a unique NPC that does not buy or sell anything, but she still charges money regularly, so I've included her in this list. She sells the player the option to repair their artifacts through her. She is the only option available to the player if they want to repair their [artifacts], and charges money and [repair runes].
