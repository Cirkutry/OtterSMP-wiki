# Star Shards

Star Shards are a form of common [currency](../Currency.md) found on OtterSMP. The main use of Star Shards are within the [Starfox] shop.
## Obtaining Star Stards

Star Shards are a very easy thing to obtain. Because of this, players need a lot of them to obtain most things from the [Starfox](../vendors/Starfox.md) shop, however it is certainly worth it.
### Dungeons

The most common method of obtaining Star Shards is by repeatedly running [dungeons](../Dungeons.md) over and over again. While yes, this method may be repetitive, the amount of Star Shards gained makes it worth the time sink. On average, one can expect around a stack of Star Shards per dungeon run.
### Voting

The second most common method to obtaining Star Shards is by voting. While yes, this is rather simple, you can only do it once per day. Every vote link, however, rewards 4x Star Shards EACH. 24x Star shards a day may not be the most incredible amount, but voting isn't a large time commitment and it eventually adds up while also helping out the server.
### Milestones

A not-so popular method of acquiring star shards is by utilizing the [milestones](../Milestones.md) feature. The reason why I say this is such an unpopular route is due to the alternative rewards the player can choose instead. While yes, a lot of star shards are up for grabs if anyone really wants them, the other options include keys, armor sets, and more.
### Trading

Lastly, players can simply trade with other players to acquire star shards. Utilizing things like the stall feature at spawn or simply peer-to-peer trading for items allows star shards to circulate throughout the world.
