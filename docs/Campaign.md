## About the Campaign
The Campaign is the official name for the missions and quests surrounding OtterSMP. It is the foundation for everything lore-related and storytelling-wise. Players can progress the storyline by playing missions and exploring the world to see what OtterSMP has to offer. It takes players through a journey on their conquest to find the [commanders](Dungeons.md) of Zelena's army and slay them in order to bring order back to the world.
